# Crime-event-localization-and-deduplication
This repository contains the source code of two applications: 
1. the Crime Ingestion App aims at extracting, geolocalizing and deduplicating crime-related news articles from online newspapers, information is stored in a database,
2. the Crime Visualization App allows visualizing crime-related data in a web application (online version is available at https://dbgroup.ing.unimore.it/crimemap).

crimedb.sql contains the structure of the database in which the news articles are stored (the database has to be created before running the Crime Ingestion App).

dump_crime_news.sql is a portion of dataset generated by the Crime Ingestion App.
